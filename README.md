# TechAssessment

You have been selected as a candidate to take our development skills assessment.  The assessment will test your skills in C#, javascript and SQL.
You will be given files of these type (.cs, .js, .sql) and asked to read, understand and alter code in those files.

To prepare for this assessment, we suggest that you do the following:
-	Have a computer ready with internet access.
-	Have Visual Studio Code installed.  This is free to download and use.
o	https://code.visualstudio.com/
o	Have the .NET SDK (version is not important)
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code
o	Have node.js
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsH-fizHkcY
o	Have a browser with WebSQL ability.  Chrome works.

Technically you don’t need to use Visual Studio Code if you have another environment in which you can run this code.  The important thing is that when we send you the test files, you are already setup to be able to execute on them.  It is a timed test, so we don’t want the setup to count against you.

To be sure these prerequisite are met, we have previously sent setup documentation.

This repository contains the atual test files.  Please place these in a folder and open that folder from Visual Studio Code.  Please be sure you can run each of these content types and see the output.  See the comments for the questions.

Please return these files to us in 1 hour, even if not all questions have been answered.
